        shell: pwsh
        run: .github/workflows/scripts/win-install-editors.ps1

### Why this script is necessary:
1.  **User Isolation:** GitHub Actions runs as a system user (`runneradmin`). Cursor and Windsurf are "User Installers" by default, meaning they install into `C:\Users\runneradmin\AppData\Local\...`.
2.  **RDP Access:** When you RDP in, you log in as `vum`. You cannot see `runneradmin`'s AppData folder easily.
3.  **The Fix:** This script installs them, then copies the application files to `C:\AI_Editors` (a neutral location) and puts a shortcut on the **Public Desktop** so you can see and launch them immediately upon logging in.
